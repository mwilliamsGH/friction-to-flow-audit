```
Select up to 3:

Client relationships and strategic direction. The initial concept ideation needs to stay human—that's where we add the soul to the work. AI can help with execution, but the creative vision must come from our team.
```

### Q31 - Are there any AI tools or prompts that already work well for you?
```
ChatGPT for first-draft copy and email templates. Midjourney for initial mood boards. I use it to generate variations I can then refine.

### Q33 - If you could press a magic button, what would it give you?
```
Speed
```

### Q34 - What task do you keep putting off because it's tedious?

Organizing and archiving old project files and versions. My shared drive is a mess with multiple versions, and I never have time to clean it up properly.
```

### Q35 - If AI gave you 5-10 extra hours per week, what would you do with them?
```
More concept exploration and design iterations. I'd love to test multiple approaches instead of rushing with the first one. Also, better collaboration with the strategy team on campaign briefs.
```

### Q36 - How would you define "AI success" for yourself?
```
I get more done in less time
```
